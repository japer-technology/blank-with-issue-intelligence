A repo based AI assistant that runs entirely through GitHub Issues and Actions. Drop a single `.issue-intelligence` folder into any repo and you have a fully functional AI agent — no servers, no external services, no extra infrastructure.

Powered by the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Every issue becomes a chat thread with an AI agent. Conversation history is committed to git, giving the agent long-term memory across sessions. It can search prior context, edit or summarize past conversations, and all changes are versioned.

Since the agent can read and write files, you can build an evolving software project that updates itself as you open issues. Try asking it to set up a GitHub Pages site, then iterate on it issue by issue.
